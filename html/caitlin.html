        <h2> Caitlin Clark</h2>
        <p> My art journey really began to grow the last couple of months of my senior year. 
            I started to do original projects and develop my artistic style. </p>
        <p> At the time, I was inspired by basketball player Caitlin Clark. 
                She played for the Iowa Hawkeyes and was known for her incredible scoring ability and work ethic on the court. 
                I wanted to recreate her celebration after one of many highlight-reel plays.</p>
        <p> I started off with a basic pencil sketch.
                     I spent many hours tweaking the sketch until it looked like my reference. 
                    I also added her name on the right side of the paper.</p>

        <p> I then started to color the sketch in with alcohol markers. 
            I began shading and adding details to make the portrait look more realistic. </p>
        <img src="../images/CaitlinClark1.jpg" alt="">
        <p> Finally, I added a yellow border to outline the drawing and bring the colors together.</p>
        <img src="../images/Snapchat-253626611.jpg" alt="">
        <p> I showed this piece at my schools art show and received positive feedback from many staff and students. 
            It then hung outside the art room until I graduated. </p>
